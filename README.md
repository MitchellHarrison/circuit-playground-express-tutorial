# Circuit Playground Express Tutorial
The [Circuit Playground Express (CPX)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) is a fantastic little machine 
with all kinds of input and output devices built right in. Each of them work slightly differently, but you 
can work with each using very few lines of code. In this repository, there are code snippets that show how 
to work with each IO device built into the board. None are particularly robust, but they will `print` to the 
serial output and give you a strong enough grasp to use anything that the CPX has to offer. From there, you
can start getting creative with your implementation!
