# Circuit Playground Express Tutorial
The [Circuit Playground Express (CPX)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) is a fantastic little machine 
with all kinds of input and output devices built right in. Each of them work slightly differently, but you 
can work with each using very few lines of code. In this repository, there are code snippets that show how 
to work with each IO device built into the board. None are particularly robust, but they will `print` to the 
serial output and give you a strong enough grasp to use anything that the CPX has to offer. From there, you
can start getting creative with your implementation!

### How to use this repo
There is a folder for each component. There may be some functions or methods that aren't covered, but basic
functionality will be covered. To run the code, replace your board's `code.py` file with the `code.py` file
included in each folder. There is also a `notes.md` file that you can read as a primer on what everything
in `code.py` is doing. There will also be plenty of comments in `code.py`, but they won't necessarily go into as
much depth.

### Got questions or comments?

I hope this helps! Happy learning. ðŸ’œ
